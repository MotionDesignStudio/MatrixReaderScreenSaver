] Description [  
It does three very unique things.

- The columns of falling text are actually reading in sequence all the text from the book Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Freire.  More books will be added.  Each column reads from the same book but they are doing it at different rates.
-  The text for each column randomly changes each drop to English, Katakana or a mixture of both.
-  Randomly chosen between 30 - 120 seconds it does one of two special effects.  There is a ripple of color changes or a small video clips from the trilogy will play in the background.

] How It Works [
Place background videos in the “bgcontent” directory.  Modify line 116 in file “Jlogic.js” with the name of the video(s) minus the extensions.  Each video must have three versions .mp4, .webm and .ogg.

Place the text you want to see falling in the file “story1.txt” located in the directory “js”.  You can modify line 18 in “Jlogic.js” to change the loaded text file.

If you encounter any bugs let me know.
